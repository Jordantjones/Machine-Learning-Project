## Overview

The focus of this project was to analyze the chocolate bar ratings database and produce a model to predict dark chocolate bar ratings from different features. Our group created a final model looking at multiple different features and parameters.   

---

## Business Problem

The problem our team was faced with was how can we accurately predict ratings for dark chocolate. Our goal was to help a company that wanted to produce dark chocolate to succucfully enter the marketplace 

---

## Data

This dataset contained dark chocolate reviews from 2006-2021. The dataset has ten columns and 2362 rows. The ten columns contain data about company name, cocoa percentage, and ingredients. Our target column in this dataset was rating.

## Methods

This project uses descriptive analyses, such as the measure of variability for budget and profitability as well as the tendency for actors in the most profitable films. This provides useful information on the impact of budget as well as actors who have taken part in the most profitable films. 

---

## Results

Budgets above 150 million dollars have a stronger correlation with profit that those below 150 million.

The 10 Actors that appeared in 10 or more of the most profitable films tended to be in a film with a mean profit above 30 million dollars.

The 20 most successful movies filtered by budget over 150 million dollars, tomatometer rating above 85, and profit above 300 million dollars had a consistent tomatometer status of Certified-Fresh.

## Conclusions


This analysis offers three recomendations to Microsoft Corporation to increase their success rate in film production.

* Produce a minimum budget for each film of least 150 million dollars and or ensure the best quality possible using budget. 

* Seek out actors who have been present in ten or more highly profitable films; the analysis provided that actors who have been present in such highly profitable films have offered a higher success rate for ongoing films.



---

## Next Steps


Further analysis could offer more in-depth predictions to increase the likelihood of film success and profitablility

* Insight to suggested budget based off film length 

* A descriptive analysis of particularly undesired outcomes based on films that have failed in the industry.
